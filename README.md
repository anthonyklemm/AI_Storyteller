As you, Tom Bombadil, walk through the meadow, with the sun casting a warm glow overhead, the colors of the flowers seem to dance before your eyes—a mosaic of nature's beauty woven into the canvas of the Old Forest. You kneel down, selecting the perfect blooms with an expert's care. The harmonies of nature fill your ears: birds singing, the soft rustle of the trees, and the babbling of the Whithywindle not far off.

"Hey dol! Merry dol!" you hum to yourself, an old tune that seems as much a part of you as your bright blue jacket and your boots the color of yellow sunlight. "What will it be today? A posy for Goldberry? Or perhaps a splash of color to brighten the mantelpiece?"

The flowers are many: bluebells and marigolds, daisies and wild lavender. You could gather them by the armful, but today something special tugs at your heartstrings. You feel a slight breeze, different somehow, carrying a hint of a mystery. There's an energy in the air, a whisper traveling with the wind. It's not often that you feel such a thing, and it piques your curiosity.

"Ring a dong dillo! A whisper on the wind? What secrets are you carrying today, my breezy friend?" You stand, looking around with eyes that have seen many an age pass by.

The breeze seems to beckon you towards the Withywindle, where the water flows with a life of its own. The trees there often speak, if one knows how to listen. As you approach, you notice something unusual by the river's edge—a glittering object half-buried under the reeds.

What do you do?

1. Investigate the glittering object by the river's edge.
2. Continue gathering flowers, sticking to the task at hand.
3. Sing to the trees, asking them about the object.

I choose to sing to the trees to get more information

You step closer to the whispering leaves and hum a tune as old as the hills, your voice a thread of gold in the green tapestry around you. The trees of the Old Forest are old and wise, and often hold secrets in their deep bark and twisted roots.

"O rowan fair, upon your hair how golden red the berries are," you sing, the melody lulling the forest into a gentle sway. "Now tell me, friends of gnarly root, what brings the wind this strange pursuit?"

The branches rustle, and the leaves twirl. They seem to hearken to your tune, and the Withywindle ripples with laughter. "Tom Bombadil, oh Tom Bombadil," the trees seem to sigh, "look to the water, look to the brook, for what lies there is more than it took."

The breeze looks to grow impatient, tugging at your hat as if urging you towards the shining mystery by the river. What secrets are carried upon the currents, what whispers through the reeds? You consider for a moment the rustling counsel. The trees have never led you astray, not in all your days wandering these woods.

"Thank you, dear friends," you offer with a bow to the trees. "To the brook, I shall go; to see what it will show!"

As you walk to the river's edge, you feel a charge in the air, a sensation that seems to thread between the very leaves and water. Excitement blooms inside of you like the flowers in your hand. What could it be that shines so with an inner light?

You stand now at the bank, the earth cool and damp beneath your boot soles. Before you is the glittering object nestled among the reeds. Its glow is gentle yet persistent, as if holding the essence of starlight within its form.

Do you:

1. Reach out tentatively, brushing away debris to reveal the object
I reach out to reveal and investigate the object.

Carefully, with a softness born of the world's ageless rhythm, you brush aside the dew-kissed reeds and the soft earth to reveal what treasure the Withywindle has cradled within its grasp. The object is smooth, its contours polished by water and time, and as your hands finally touch it, you feel a warmth spread through your fingertips—a warmth that speaks of magic old and true.

It's a stone, but not just any stone: within its crystalline depths, there swirls a light, blue and green and clear as the sky on a summer's day. It pulses, almost in time with the beating heart of the forest.

"Ah, a gem of the river, a treasure of water and light. What brings you here into Tom's sight?" you muse aloud, curiosity like a bird fluttering in your chest.

The stone almost seems to resonate with your voice, the light within it dancing more fervently.


Your instincts hum with the power of this gem, feeling its connection to the land around you. This is no ordinary find; the stone is filled with a song all its own, a melody that yearns to join with yours.

If you choose to sing to the stone, perhaps your voices combined could awaken the stories it holds. Yet, Goldberry is wise in the ways of water and its wonders, and she might shed light on this mystery. Alternatively, there is a respect in returning what the river has cradled, acknowledging that some treasures are not meant to be held, but to flow free.

In the midst of your pondering, the forest holds its breath, the Withywindle's stream pauses in anticipation, and even the breeze seems to hang on your decision. The world around you is a tableau, awaiting the next note in the symphony of this day.

What path does Tom Bombadil choose?

1. "Let's sing, O twinkling stone, and together weave a tale unknown." You prepare to lend your voice to the stone's hidden magic.
2. "To Goldberry, this gem must go, for her wisdom is deep as river flow." You think to secure the stone safely in your pocket.
3. "Back to your home, beneath the flow, to dance with the river and withywindle's glow." Gently, you consider returning the stone to the river.

Each choice carries weight, the potential to shape the story of today and the days that come after. For in a world where magic intertwines with every bough and brook, a simple act can echo through the ages.

Now, Tom Bombadil, what do you decide?
Tom decides to sing to the stone.

You cradle the gem in your palm, marveling at the soft luminescence that seems to warmly greet your decision. Smiling, you draw a deep breath, and as naturally as the river flows and the birds sing, you begin your song:

"Bright is the water, and bright are the skies,
Whence came this jewel with sun in its eyes?
Old are the stories, and old are the tunes,
Reveal now your secrets, as day turns to noons."

Your voice carries with it the weight of years unnumbered, the joy of the living Earth, and as you sing, the gem in your hand vibrates with a resonant harmony. Its glow intensifies, and the light expands, weaving with your melody until your surroundings are bathed in a radiant tapestry of sound and color.

Then, spontaneously, as though it recognizes its cue, the stone illuminates brilliantly, projecting an intricate dance of lights around you. These glimmers coalesce into images—a vision that begins to play out around you, ethereal and translucent, yet vibrant with life.

You see the ancient days of Middle-earth unfolding as if painted by light: the towering trees of the primordial forests, the first awakening of the Elves by the waters, and the craftsmanship of the Dwarves delving deep into the heart of the mountains. The scenes shift, and you witness the rise and fall of kingdoms, the ebb and flow of powers beyond mortal ken.

The stone's vision seems to zoom in, focusing now on a figure, cloaked, standing by the banks of a great river. The figure holds a stone much like the one in your hand and releases it gently into the water. As the stone sinks, the light within it spreads through the river's veins, flowing into the land, a gift of protection and life.

Then, as quickly as it started, the illumination wanes, the visions disperse, and the forest around you returns to its peaceful state. The stone in your hand dims to a faint glimmer, returning to a state of tranquility, yet still humming faintly with the memory of the song. You stand amidst the quiet woods, reflections of the visions you witnessed playing softly in your thoughts.

"Tom's seen the days of yore," you murmur to yourself, a smile playing on your lips. "And secrets of the stone are secrets no more."

After a moment of silence, where only the gentle whispers of the Withywindle can be heard, you ponder what to do next with the engraved story. You have been granted a glimpse into the ancient past, a story of power and preservation.

Do you:

1. Take the stone to Goldberry, sharing both its light and the visions it revealed.
2. Hide the stone somewhere safe where its magic can continue to defend the land.
3. Continue your day as you began, carrying the stone as a silent companion, pondering its tale.

Take the stone to Goldberry. We must not let this stone fall into the wrong hands.

You nod to yourself, confident in your decision. "To Goldberry will I take this starlit stone, for her insight shall guide what is to be done."

With care, you slide the smooth gem into a deep pocket, its warmth against your side a gentle reminder of the day's unusual turn. You begin your journey home, the path familiar beneath your boots, a trail you've walked a thousand times—a dance of footfalls amidst the greenery.

As you make your way to the cottage you share with Goldberry, where the Withywindle's song grows louder with each step, you can't help but feel a sense of urgency. The visions granted by the stone were not just mere phantasms; they carried a weight, a duty, it seems, handed down through ages long passed.

"Hey now! Merry dol! The story's not yet all told!" you sing out, a tune to quell the growing unease. You know the world outside the Old Forest is vast and filled with many a wandering eye. Some, no doubt, would seek to claim the power of such a stone for darker purposes.

The sun has begun its descent, painting the sky in warm hues as you approach your doorstep. Though the day's light wanes, the glimmer from your pocket seems to hold a piece of the day within it, a promise that light persists even as twilight encroaches.

You push open the door, and there stands Goldberry, the River-daughter, as fair as the first bloom of spring. Her eyes, reflecting the light of the setting sun, meet yours, and in them, you sense she already perceives something has altered this day's tranquil weave.

"Tom Bombadil," she greets with a soft smile, her voice the very essence of the softly flowing Withywindle. "What stories do you carry on the winds, my heart?"

I give her the flowers and go about thinking of a song to sing to her that explains the essence of what I experienced today.

"O Goldberry, River's Queen," you begin, your arms outstretched as you move gracefully towards her, the flowers you've gathered held out like an offering. "Here be blooms of field and dell, and tales of light and shadow to tell."

You place the flowers in her open arms, their colors vibrant against the simple elegance of her gown. A fragrance of earth and petal rose between you.

"Now listen well, for a song I have, of a stone's light bold and a vision that Tom's old heart did grab," you continue, your voice carrying both the warmth of the meadow and the depth of the river from whence Goldberry came.

With the flowers set aside, you take a seat next to Goldberry, your words mellifluous as you weave a melody that encapsulates the adventures of the day, the mysterious stone, and the visions it bewitched you with:

"In the light of day did Tom wander,
Amongst bloom and leaf in yonder.
By Withywindle’s whispering bend,
A glinting secret to apprehend.

A stone of river's make I found,
With light of stars and sun’s round.
It sang of ancient times and lore,
Of Elven kin and Dwarven core.

Of kingdoms rise and darkness fall,
And one who by the river tall,
Cast such a stone into the stream,
To guard the land, a hopeful dream.

Now Goldberry, O River's child,
The stone to you, through woods wild.
For in your wisdom, pure and deep,
Its fate and fortune you shall keep."

Goldberry listens intently, her eyes reflecting the tale you sing, softly aglow with the knowledge of river and rain. When your song reaches its end, silence cradles the room for a moment—a quiet, profound and full of thought.

“Well done, my Tom,” she finally speaks, her voice a murmur as sweet as the water over the stones. “The stone’s tale within your song has travelled through time long and long. Its place with us will now reside, by river's song and forest wide.”

She holds out her slender hand, a silent request for the gem that you've safely tucked away. You reach into your pocket, the fabric worn soft by countless days beneath the sun and stars, and gently hand over the stone with the reverence it deserves.

As the stone passes into Goldberry's keeping, you can't help but feel the weight of the day's events settle around you like a cloak woven from the threads of an epic tapestry. And as you do, a sense of peace fills the room, a tranquility born of the certainty that you have acted well and truly.

Goldberry cradles the stone in her hands, looking at it with a mix of wonder and recognition. It is clear that she feels its deep connection to the river and the land.

"Now rest, my Tom," she says with gentle firmness. "For the morrow may yet hold new songs to be sung and new tales to unfold."

With those final words, Goldberry turns, moving to the window where the last light of day spills in, touching the stone with a hint of twilight. You watch her, feeling the pull of the evening's quietude, the ancient rhythms of the water and the wood that call you to rest.

But before you allow yourself to drift into reverie, Goldberry turns to you, her eyes alight with a soft and radiant glow.

"Tom, before you wander in dream’s mead, know this," she whispers with the faintest smile playing on her lips, "the stone shall keep us safe, its secrets sealed, but should it call again, we shall answer, hearts unyield and hands ready to aid."

And with that promise lingering in the air, she nods to you—a queen in her simple domain, as regal and as natural as the river from which she was born. You rise, stretching limbs that have roamed far and sung much, and move towards the comfort of your chair by the fire that waits to lull you to slumber.

"Ah, Goldberry, my fairest," you murmur, content and with eyes half-closed. "Tom shall dream of days past, and paths yet walked. But his heart is ever at ease, knowing the guardian of the river watches over the stone.”

And just before the realm of sleep claims you, before the last log in the hearth cracks and sends a shower of sparks upwards, you think you see the stone's gentle glow one more time—a beacon ensuring that all is as it should be.

Goldberry stands there, the River-daughter, the keeper of mysteries, as night blankets the Old Forest, and all its denizens settle into the silence of deep dark. The stone, your discovery, your burden and gift, is safe in her watchful care.

The end, for now.
